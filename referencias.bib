  abstract = "The aim of this study was to investigate, using eye-tracking
              technique, the influence of bottom-up and top-down processes on
              visual behavior while subjects, na{\"\i}ve to art criticism, were
              presented with representational paintings. Forty-two subjects
              viewed color and black and white paintings (Color) categorized as
              dynamic or static (Dynamism) (bottom-up processes). Half of the
              images represented natural environments and half human subjects
              (Content); all stimuli were displayed under aesthetic and
              movement judgment conditions (Task) (top-down processes). Results
              on gazing behavior showed that content-related top-down processes
              prevailed over low-level visually-driven bottom-up processes when
              a human subject is represented in the painting. On the contrary,
              bottom-up processes, mediated by low-level visual features,
              particularly affected gazing behavior when looking at
              nature-content images. We discuss our results proposing a
              reconsideration of the definition of content-related top-down
              processes in accordance with the concept of embodied simulation
              in art perception.",
