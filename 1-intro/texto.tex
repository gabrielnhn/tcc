\chapter{Introduction}

We reached a point in computer vision research where there are already so many resources --- such as state-of-the-art artificial intelligence models or image processing algorithms --- that finding use for the tools we have can be as important as coming up with more of them.

It's known that eye-tracking can be quite useful for machines, in order to obtain data used to train AI models for object-reference or decision-making tasks, learn to recognize the context of an image, and can be used by robots to better understand social cues when interacting with humans \cite{ijcai2020-689}; for instance, intelligent tutoring systems can automatically detect when students are mind-wandering \cite{Hutt2016TheEH}.

But gaze estimation can also be used by humans themselves to better comprehend abstract and complex subjects, like analysing art paintings \cite{Massaro2012-jx}.
